<h1>Food Ordering System for University Canteen(NoshUp)</h1>
<p>The existing method of ordering food involves standing in a queue in order to purchase token for the food we wish to have. It is a tiring and a time-consuming process. Thus the system makes this entire purchase digital with online payment. The student is provided with an application where authenticate he/she is listed with all food items available in the canteen at that university time from which they can select the items they want. The user is requested to have the required cash in the wallet before placing order. Wallet money can be refilled using e-payment. Once the order is confirmed, order details is updated in the order history by admin. The quantity of food available is updated by an in-charge in the canteen using the admin web application. <br>The admin can add a new food item, update the quantity of available food item or remove a food item when it gets over. This will avoid users from ordering items that are already finished.Also admin can manage orders which comes from student and update order status which reflect in user appliction</p>
